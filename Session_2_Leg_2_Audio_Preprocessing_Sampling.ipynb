        "Audio resampling, also known as sample rate conversion or resampling, is the process of changing the sample rate of an audio signal. The sample rate refers to the number of samples taken per second to represent the audio waveform digitally.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resampling is performed to alter the duration or playback speed of an audio signal or to match the sample rates of different audio sources. It involves modifying the sequence of audio samples to either increase or decrease the number of samples per second.\n",
        "\n",
        "When upsampling (increasing the sample rate), new samples need to be generated to fill in the gaps between existing samples. This requires interpolation techniques to estimate the new sample values based on the original samples. Conversely, when downsampling (decreasing the sample rate), the process involves discarding some of the original samples to reduce the overall data rate. Filtering is often applied to remove frequencies beyond the new Nyquist limit (half the new sample rate) to avoid aliasing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resampling algorithms can vary in complexity and performance. Common interpolation methods include nearest-neighbor, linear interpolation, spline interpolation, sinc interpolation, and polyphase filtering. The choice of resampling algorithm depends on factors such as the desired quality, computational efficiency, and specific requirements of the application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Audio resampling is widely used in various audio-related applications, including music production, audio editing, multimedia playback, telecommunication systems, digital signal processing, and audio analysis. It allows for time scaling, synchronization, matching sample rates, compatibility, and various other operations that require manipulating the temporal characteristics of audio signals."

        "\n",
        "    Matching Sample Rates: Audio signals may have different sample rates, and resampling allows us to bring them to a common sample rate. This is crucial when working with audio data from various sources or when combining audio signals for analysis or processing.\n",

        "High-quality resampling refers to the process of changing the sample rate of an audio signal while minimizing the introduction of artifacts and preserving the audio's original quality. The samplerate library in Python provides a reliable and efficient way to perform high-quality resampling.\n",

        "\n",
        "    Sinc interpolation: This method uses a sinc function as an interpolation kernel to estimate the new sample values. It provides excellent audio quality with minimal distortion and aliasing artifacts. Sinc interpolation is computationally intensive but produces accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Polyphase filtering: Polyphase resampling divides the resampling process into multiple stages using polyphase filters. It reduces computational complexity while maintaining high-quality resampling. Polyphase filtering is particularly useful for real-time applications and efficient resampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    Linear interpolation: Linear interpolation estimates new sample values by interpolating between neighboring samples using a straight line. It provides smoother resampling results compared to zero-order hold but may not capture the fine details of the original signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) resampling: This method employs the FFT algorithm to convert the audio signal into the frequency domain, perform resampling, and then apply an inverse FFT to obtain the resampled signal. It can provide efficient and accurate resampling, particularly for large sample rate changes.\n",

        "To perform high-quality resampling using the samplerate library, you need to follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Load the original audio signal using a suitable library like librosa or soundfile.\n",
        "    Specify the desired sample rate for the resampled signal.\n",
        "    Choose the appropriate resampling algorithm from the samplerate library.\n",
        "    Use the selected resampling algorithm to resample the audio signal, providing the original sample rate, desired sample rate, and audio data.\n",
